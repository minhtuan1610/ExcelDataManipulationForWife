This is the explanation from chatGPT about the issue "maximum stack size exceeded" occurs in `script-filter.js` but not in `index.html` in folder TestCode.

Save this for later research.

The "maximum stack" error you're encountering in `script-filter.js` is likely due to the way the data is being processed and the complexity of the operations you're performing, such as grouping and iterating through the JSON. Let's break down why the issue might occur in `script-filter.js` but not in `index.html`.

### Differences between `script-filter.js` and `index.html`:

1. **File Handling Complexity**:

   - In `index.html`, you are simply converting the first sheet of the Excel file to JSON and displaying it directly on the page. This is a lightweight operation.
   - In `script-filter.js`, after converting the Excel to JSON, you are performing additional grouping and iterating over the JSON objects. This increases the complexity of the operation and requires more memory, which might lead to the "maximum stack size exceeded" error.

2. **JSON Grouping and Processing**:

   - In `script-filter.js`, you're using `Object.groupBy` to group the JSON data by "TRN Date" and "FILE SEQ". If the dataset is large or if there are deeply nested objects, this can cause a stack overflow error due to too many recursive or iterative operations.
   - In contrast, `index.html` just displays the JSON without extra processing, making it less resource-intensive.

3. **Browser Limitations**:
   - Stack size limits in JavaScript can vary between different browsers and even between different operations within the same script. The extra processing in `script-filter.js` might be hitting these limits when handling larger datasets or complex operations, but `index.html` avoids this by keeping the process simpler.

### Possible Fixes for `script-filter.js`:

1. **Optimize the Grouping Operation**:

   - The `Object.groupBy` method might be causing excessive memory usage or deep recursion. You can try breaking down the grouping process into smaller steps or using a more memory-efficient approach.

2. **Process Data in Chunks**:

   - If your dataset is large, try processing it in smaller chunks to avoid overwhelming the browser's memory. This can be done by breaking the JSON data into smaller arrays before performing the grouping and iteration.

3. **Use `setTimeout` for Long Operations**:

   - JavaScript can hit a "maximum stack" issue when there is too much synchronous processing. You can use `setTimeout()` to break the operation into smaller tasks, allowing the browser to handle the load better. For example, batch-process the records in chunks of 100 or 1000, depending on the size.

4. **Inspect Data Size**:
   - Check the size of the data you're working with in `script-filter.js`. If the dataset is unexpectedly large, you might want to add some validation to reject large files or warn the user.

Would you like help modifying the code to implement one of these optimizations?
